# Conclusions

## Conclusions

QUIC is a new network protocol that resides in the application layer over UDP. Google developed QUIC as an alternative to TCP. Two browsers (Chrome and Opera) and Google servers are the only entities that support QUIC. When a user accesses Googleâ€™s services such as Gmail over the aforementioned browsers, the data transfer will use UDP-based QUIC.

## Future Works

* Designing new tests to measure fairness when sharing bandwidth with other QUIC/TCP flows
* Stream Multiplexing in QUIC: Evaluate advantages over loading HTTP pages, for example.
* Connection Migration
* QUIC over a Wireless Network
